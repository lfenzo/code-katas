# Fizz-Buzz

FizzBuzz is one of the most famous coding exercises for beginners. It is a simple exercise
but an excellent one to start learning the TDD flow with.

## Requirements

1. Write a `fizzBuzz` method that accepts a number as input and returns it as a String.

Notes:

- Start with the minimal failing solution
- Keep the three rules in mind and always write just sufficient enough code
- Do not forget to refactor your code after each passing test
- Write your assertions relating to the exact requirements

2. For multiples of 3 return `“Fizz”` instead of the number

3. For the multiples of 5 return `“Buzz”`

4. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 return `“FizzBuzz”`.
